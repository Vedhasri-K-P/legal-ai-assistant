#  Legal AI Assistant — Document Intelligence Prototype

A Python-based **legal document intelligence system** designed to analyze unstructured legal text and assist users through **context-aware querying**, **risk surfacing**, and **simplification of legal language**.

This project focuses on **practical LLM integration with real documents**, not generic chatbot behavior.

---

##  What This System Does

- Ingests legal documents (PDF / Word)
- Extracts and structures raw legal text
- Identifies important clauses and potential risk areas
- Enables users to ask questions grounded in uploaded documents
- Assists with legal understanding using controlled LLM responses

Built as a **prototype to explore document-grounded AI workflows**.

##  Key Features

-  **Document Analysis**  
  Parses uploaded legal documents to extract key clauses and highlight potential risk areas.

-  **Context-Aware Legal Q&A**  
  Allows users to ask questions based on uploaded documents or predefined legal text, reducing generic LLM responses.

-  **Insights Dashboard**  
  Displays simplified summaries and categorized legal insights for easier understanding.

-  **Legal Quiz Mode**  
  Interactive quiz to reinforce legal concepts and test understanding.

---

##  Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python  
- **Frontend / Prototyping:** Streamlit  
- **LLM API:** Groq (Llama-based models)  
- **Document Processing:** PyPDF2  
- **Data Handling:** Pandas  

---

##  Design Choices & Tradeoffs

- Focused on **fast prototyping and usability** over heavy abstractions
- Prioritized document grounding to reduce hallucinated responses
- Used Streamlit to quickly validate workflows and user interactions
- Kept the architecture simple to allow future expansion into RAG or agent-based systems

---

##  Running the Project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/legal-ai-assistant.git
cd legal-ai-assistant
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py

---

##  Limitations

- This is a prototype and not a substitute for professional legal advice.
- Responses depend on document quality and extracted context.
- Retrieval logic can be further improved with vector-based indexing.

---

##  Future Improvements

- Integrate vector-based retrieval for large document sets.
- Add citation-based responses to improve trust and traceability.
- Improve clause risk scoring and prioritization.
- Introduce multi-step reasoning workflows for complex queries.
